<h1>Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes</h1>

* We used document.querySelectorAll to check all input[type="checkbox"]
* We added .addEventListener to see if the checkboxes were checked('click')
* We add function to check if Shift key was down and the box was checked
* Created a variable (inBetween) to move between checkboxes and see if they are checked
